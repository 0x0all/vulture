TODOs
=====

* Detect unreachable code Ã  la ``if False:`` (try to evaluate condition).
  * Later more AST nodes: If, IfExp, While, Assert.
* Detect unreachable code after ``break``, ``continue`` and ``raise`` statements.
* Once we drop Python 2.6 compatibility use argparse instead of optparse.
* Always report number of lines? Increases runtime by a factor of ~1.08.
* Support Python 3.5 async/await (#20).
* Add confidence values to Items and ``--min-confidence`` flag.
* Test count_lines() by computing it for all nodes in a big Python project
  and comparing the results to count_lines_slow(). Always do this comparison
  in verbose mode.


Non-TODOs
=========

* Ignore hidden files and directories (might be unexpected, use --exclude instead).
* Differentiate between functions and methods. For our purposes methods are
  functions with a "self" parameter and they are stored as attributes, not as
  variables. However, we can't differentiate between function and method executions.
* Use Assign instead of Name AST nodes for estimating the size of assignments (KISS).
* Only count lines for unused code by storing a function ``get_size`` in
  Item for computing the size on demand. This is 1.5 times as slow as computing
  no sizes.


Notes
=====

* Use astroid if we ever want to support scopes.
